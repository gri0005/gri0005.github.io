    <h3>
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?

    <p>First thing: colour & text, then elements</p>
    <h3>
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.

    <h3>
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h3>
    <p>definitely spent the most time engaging with the soccer game</p>
    <h3>
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>the most common action was clicking the soccer ball</p>
    <h3>
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      intended primary goal is to provide an engaging experience which will
      coerce user into downloading apps
    </p>
    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>
      that was communicated through the "discover" or "enter" button in the
      corner, which has insistent animations - clearly wanting to be clicked -
      and the limited text on screen, and the app and phone/laptop elements
      within each scene
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h3>
    <p>
      my impression is that the experience should be interacted with briefly,
      about 10 minutes max, and on no more than a few (maybe 3) occasions
    </p>
    <h3>
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      That's because there is only so much to do, and the natural conclusion to
      the experience is downloading the apps, which would mean there's no longer
      a need to visit the site.
    </p>

    <h2>part 2</h2>
    <h3>
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The experience references app media forms, advertisement and video games
      through design elements and explicit content.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tells you that you should continue engaging interactively and
      investing in it
    </p>
    <h3>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>This tells you that you should feel competetive and gratified</p>
    <h3>
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most frustrating part is the absence of things - the loading times,
      the things that don't do anything, the things that do something but you
      can't tell what
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most satisfying part is the tree that drops leaves. It's satisfying
      because it's sustained interactivity, and it's pretty, and it feels
      tangible - it has a tactile quality almost - and it follows your mouse so
      it feels like a higher degree of control - like you're doing the thing,
      not just starting the chain reaction. It's closer to real life ig. More
      immediacy??
