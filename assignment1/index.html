    spent the most time engaging with the soccer game the most common action was
    clicking the soccer ball intended primary goal is to provide an engaging
    experience which will coerce user into downloading apps that was
    communicated through the "discover" or "enter" button in the corner, which
    has insistent animations - clearly wanting to be clicked - and the limited
    text on screen, and the app and phone/laptop elements within each scene my
    impression is that the experience should be interacted with briefly, about
    10 minutes max, and on no more than a few (maybe 3) occasions That's because
    there is only so much to do, and the natural conclusion to the experience is
    downloading the apps, which would mean there's no longer a need to visit the
    site. The experience references app media forms, advertisement and video
    games through design elements and explicit content. This tells you that you
    should continue engaging interactively and investing in it This tells you
    that you should feel competetive and gratified The most frustrating part is
    the absence of things - the loading times, the things that don't do
    anything, the things that do something but you can't tell what The most
    satisfying part is the tree that drops leaves. It's satisfying because it's
    sustained interactivity, and it's pretty, and it feels tangible - it has a
    tactile quality almost - and it follows your mouse so it feels like a higher
    degree of control - like you're doing the thing, not just starting the chain
    reaction. It's closer to real life ig.
