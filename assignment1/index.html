        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed right away when opening the link to Luni was
        the colourful pastel colour scheme. The second thing, almost instantly
        after, and which I read almost unconsciously was the big white text,
        placed toward the upper centre half of the screen and dominating the
        background of the home page.

        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I definitely spent the most time engaging with the soccer game, clicking
        on the ball and trying to get it into the goals. This is mostly
        attributable to the fact that I wanted the gratification of getting the
        ball in the goal, but ended up getting the ball stuck to the side of the
        goal and had to spend a lot of time getting it positioned back to a
        place where it was possible to get a goal. I was invested in the game,
        and I refused to move on until I got a succesful result.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most common action by far was clicking the soccer ball. In general,
        my interactions with the experience involved a lot of spam clicking and
        repeated actions, which was rewarded by the satisfying animations.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Over the course of the interactive experience, I (the user) felt a
        consistent sense of gratification and reward. It seems that the intended
        primary goal of this experience is to provide a rewarding experience,
        which will convince the user to download various apps in order to extend
        that feeling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The "discover" or "enter" button in the corner, which leads to a
        promotional popup for the app, had insistent animations - clearly
        inviting and enticing the user to click them. The limited text on
        screen, and the app and phone/laptop elements within each scene also
        further this agenda.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It seems that the experience should be interacted with briefly, for
        about 10 minutes, maximum. The experience could certainly be interacted
        with on more than one occassion, but likely no more than a handful of
        times.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the experience, there is only so much to do. After exploring the few
        interactive elements in each of the pages, the intended natural
        conclusion to the experience is downloading the apps, which would mean
        there's no longer any need to visit the site. At that point, it has
        served its purpose.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>portion 2</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The experience references app media forms, advertisement and video games
        through design elements and explicit content. There are images of
        laptops and phones represented in many of the environments, implying the
        relevance of apps and internet. Apps are also explicitly referenced in
        the promotional screens, convincing the user to download specific
        services, turning the whole experience into a big example of
        advertisement media. Video game design elements are also appropriated,
        such as the coins and reward animations in certain mini-game animation
        elements.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The experience's resemblance to video games communicates to the user
        that it can and should be experienced interactively. The game connection
        may also cultivate a mindset of consumption, as the coins are similar to
        those used prominently in games that feature in-app purchases.
        Similarly, the advertising elements of the experience inform the user
        that they are expected to undertake an action, i.e. download an app, if
        they have enjoyed the experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What does this communicate to you about how you should feel when
        engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        These elements encourage the user to feel competetive when interacting
        with gamified elements, gratified when receiving some kind of tokenistic
        reward from those elements, and motivated to invest (either resources or
        time) in the product.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most frustrating part of the experience is the absence of things -
        the loading times, the graphic elements on screen that aren't
        interactive or animated, the elements that are clearly meant to be
        interactive, but which you can't decipher how they are, or which seem to
        have no change when you click on them. The high satisfaction of the
        interactive elements makes the contrasting frustration all the more
        potent.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the experience is the tree that drops leaves
        when you mouseover it. I believe part of the reason it's so satisfying
        is that it involves a more sustained interactivity - the tree stretches
        and moves to follow your mouse as well as dropping leaves, so it's not
        just a single discrete action like a mouse click. The graphic is also
        pretty, and it has a tangible, tactile quality. The way the tree follows
        your mouse, it feels like you (the user) have a higher degree of control
        - like you're enacting the effect yourself, rather than just triggering
        a chain reaction, as with a single mouse click. It gives you a stronger
        sense of agency and immediacy. That's very satisfying.
